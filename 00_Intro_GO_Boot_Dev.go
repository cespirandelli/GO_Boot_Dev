// GO is much faster than JS, Python, Ruby and PHP.
// This happens because GO is a compiled language
// Every interpreted programming language is slower, by it's nature.
//---------------------//

// Welcome to "Learn GO" from Boot.Dev
// For the next lessons, we'll write a "Textio" Web Server

// Since this program builds into an executable, we start using
package main

// Format function import
import "fmt"

// Every GO Program, starts with "main" function.
// It takes no inputs and doesn't return anything.

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Starting Textio Server") // "Print Line" function
}
